🛡️ AI Fraud & Compliance Brain for Indian FinTech
A GenAI-powered regulatory intelligence engine for India’s financial ecosystem

🚀 Overview

AI Fraud & Compliance Brain is a GenAI application built using Streamlit + OpenAI + Python that ingests regulatory PDFs from Indian authorities (e.g., RBI, SEBI, IRDAI) and automatically generates:

🔍 Regulatory change extraction

📝 Impact summaries for FinTechs & NBFCs

📋 Auto-generated compliance checklists

🚨 Risk exposure predictions for NBFCs / PSPs

📄 Downloadable compliance reports (JSON / Markdown)

This project solves a real problem in India where FinTechs struggle to keep up with fast-changing compliance guidelines.

🎯 Why This Project Matters

Indian FinTech is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world — but also the most regulated.

Every week:

RBI releases new circulars

NBFC guidelines change

Fraud/KYC norms tighten

PSP ecosystem rules evolve

New risk alerts get introduced

Compliance teams manually read PDFs, interpret changes, and create checklists.
This project automates 80% of that work.

Understand regulation + AI + product design

Build tangible GovTech/FinTech AI applications
